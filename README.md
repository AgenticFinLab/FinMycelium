## Overview

**FinMycelium** is a cutting-edge **Financial Event Reconstruction Platform** built on a Multi-Agent Framework, designed to extract, process, and reconstruct complete financial events from diverse public sources. Built with a modular architecture and powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), its multi-agent system specializes in automated collection, matching, summarization, and structured reconstruction of financial events, transforming unstructured financial data into actionable intelligence.

---

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Source Data Collection**: Web URLs, PDF documents, and social media platforms
- **Multi-Agent Event Processing**: Coordinated agent system for LLM-based financial event matching and reconstruction
- **Event Reconstruction Pipeline**: End-to-end configurable pipeline for financial event extraction
- **Structured Financial Events**: Transform unstructured data into structured event cascades with clear relationships and timelines
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based interactive UI for financial event analysis and visualization


---

## To Do List

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- API Keys for LLM services (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgenticFinLab/FinMycelium.git
cd FinMycelium
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys and configuration settings.

### Basic Usage

#### Using the Pipeline
```python
from finmy.pipeline import FinmyPipeline
import yaml

# Load configuration
with open("configs/pipline.yml", "r") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize and run pipeline
pipeline = FinmyPipeline(config)
pipeline.lm_build_pipeline_main(
    data_sources=["https://example.com/financial-news"],
    query_text="金融风控",
    key_words=["金融风控", "合规"]
)
```

#### Web Interface
```bash
streamlit run examples/utest/test_web_interface.py
```
