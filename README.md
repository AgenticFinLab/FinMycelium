**Financial Event Reconstruction • Multi-Agent • Intelligent • Modular • AI-Powered**

---

> How can the complete chronological process of a specific event, particularly a financial event, be reconstructed as a structured timeline such as a Gantt chart from large-scale, heterogeneous, and noisy real-world data?

> **FinMycelium**, a name borrowed from "finance" and "mycelium" is a **Financial Event Reconstruction Platform** that reconstructs the complete financial event process as a structured timeline from multi-source, diverse public documents. Our platform is built on a large model–based multi-agent system, in which agents cooperate to collect, match, and summarize large-scale, heterogeneous, and noisy real-world data, ultimately building a comprehensive and structured reconstruction of the event.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Source Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from diverse sources, including news articles, social media, official reports, regulatory filings, and other public documents.
- **Data Matching and Summarization**: Identify, align, and condense useful information across heterogeneous sources to directly support financial event reconstruction.
- **Event Reconstruction**: Leverage a large model–based multi-agent system to autonomously integrate, connect, and reconstruct coherent event narratives from fragmented financial data.
- **Structured Presentation**: Visualize the reconstructed timeline using Gantt charts and ???? to deliver a clear, structured overview of the event.
- **Web Interface**: Provide an intuitive, Streamlit-based interactive UI for real-time financial event analysis, exploration, and visualization.

## To Do List

> - [ ] Address the issue of exceeding context *length limits* in both prompts and model-generated outputs.
> - [ ] Re-architect FinMycelium as a *fully agent-based* platform.
> - [ ] Optimize the event reconstruction pipeline to improve processing *speed*.
> - [ ] Expand the *range of data sources* for data collection.
> - [ ] Implement *multi-language support* in the web interface.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- API Keys for LLM services (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgenticFinLab/FinMycelium.git
cd FinMycelium
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys and configuration settings.

### Basic Usage

#### Using the Pipeline
```python
from finmy.pipeline import FinmyPipeline
import yaml

# Load configuration
with open("configs/pipline.yml", "r") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize and run pipeline
pipeline = FinmyPipeline(config)
pipeline.lm_build_pipeline_main(
    data_sources=[
      "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/zhimin-qian-cryptocurrency-fraud-scheme-jailed-uk-intl-hnk",
      "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/11/fraudster-who-hid-in-london-is-jailed-over-bitcoin-scam",
      "https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/two-people-imprisoned-their-key-roles-largescale-money-laundering-case"
    ],
    query_text="What is the case involving fraud and money laundering by Qian Zhimin?",
    key_words=["fraud", " money laundering"]
)
```

#### Web Interface
```bash
streamlit run examples/utest/test_web_interface.py
```
